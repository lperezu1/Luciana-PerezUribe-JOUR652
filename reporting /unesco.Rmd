UNESCO allows you to download a file containing limited information on all the languages listed in the Interactive Atlas.
The limited data include the following types of data for all the languages listed in the Atlas:
  
Language name in English
Language name in French
Language name in Spanish
Country(ies) or area(s) where the language is spoken
Country code(s)
Language codes ISO 639-3



Degree of vitality - 

The present edition designates the degrees of endangerment a little differently than the previous editions. The new terminology is based on UNESCOâ€™s Language Vitality and Endangerment framework that establishes six degrees of vitality/endangerment based on nine factors. Of these factors, the most salient is that of intergenerational transmission.


Degree of endangerment	Intergenerational Language Transmission
1. Safe- language is spoken by all generations; intergenerational transmission is uninterrupted. Not included in the Atlas
2. Vulnerable	- vulnerable	most children speak the language, but it may be restricted to certain domains (e.g., home)
3. Definitely endangered	- definitely endangered	children no longer learn the language as mother tongue in the home
4. Severely endangered	- severely endangered	language is spoken by grandparents and older generations; while the parent generation may understand it, they do not speak it to children or among themselves
5. Critically endangered	- critically endangered	the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently
6. Extinct - 	extinct	there are no speakers left -  included in the Atlas if presumably extinct since the 1950s

<p class= "intro">
In 1999, two young men killed 12 students and wounded 24 others at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. The incident sparked a long series of school shootings in the United States that has continues to this day.
Not a single year has passed since 1999 without at least five school shootings in the U.S. There have been at least 214 school shootings since Columbine, according to newly released data by The Washington Post that examines school shootings at secondary and primary schools in the U.S since the Columbine shooting.</p>

</div>

<p class= "text container"> At least five school school shootings have occurred every year since 1999, with an average number of 11 shootings per-year.  2006 and 2014 had the highest number of incidents with fifteen and sixteen school shootings, respectively. As can be seen the chart below, the past three years have remained consistently high, with at least a dozen incidents each year.</p>

<p class= "text container"> With little government or academic research into the phenomenon of school shootings, the Post’s data gives an important look into the specifics of school shootings in the U.S. Below we examine this data, alongside other available data sources, for insights about school shootings, school shooters and their victims.</p>

   <p>The number of shootings per year has generally remained high in the US since the turn of the century, with noticeable dips in 2002, 2011 and 2015. The last three years, the number of shootings has been consistently high.</p>

<p class= "text container"> An analysis of the data shows that cities with the most number of school shootings tend to be large urban areas with high crime rates. Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia top the list with five school shootings each. The data also reveals that the majority of shootings occur in places that would be considered “cities”, while just 14% occur in rural areas (see chart below).

    <h5 class="card-title">About the Data</h5>
    <p class="card-text">School shooting data is surprisingly messy and hard to come by. There are few government or academic studies on the subject and those that do exist are mostly outdated. Further, school shooting data tends to be messy and hard to deal with. According to The Atlantic, the parameters of school shooting incidents makes data inconsistent.
